#### Description:
Hi. My name is Patrycja. I come from Poland. I have lived in Warsaw all my life.
I called my project "Dance in everyday life".
Dance is my passion, I have been practicing it in classes for almost 7 years.
Through this project, I wanted to encourage people to dance every day.
1) I present in my web application why it is worth choosing dance as a daily physical activity
2) In addition, it briefly outlines the history of different types of dance, because dance is very diverse.
3) At the same time, it shows many health benefits of this type of activity.
4) Moreover, it shows how some people celebrate the international dance day.
5) At the very end, I ask the recipient of my website to fill out a short survey.
6) And then shows her the results.

In my web application I used python, html, css, sql and java script.

- I used the Flask library in python.
- I used html to create the page.
- I used CSS to give my website aesthetics and elegance.
- SQL so that the data from the form in the "form" section goes to my database on the computer.
- A Javascript to create elegant and professional charts in the "results" section

The project consists of 7 visible and one hidden pages.
- The main page (home.html) contains a description of the project and the logo of the course.
- The first page (why.html) describes, from the perspective of a dancer with many years of experience, what dance is and why it is worth practicing it.
- The second page (history.html) contains a video and some photos. Moreover, it describes the history of several types of dance.At the same time, it contains a professional table of contents, which takes us to a specific type of dance after clicking on the name.
- The third page (benefits.html) describes the many health benefits of dancing.
- The fourth page (day.html) contains a brief history of "International Dance Day" and the official artwork of "International Dance Day 2022"+
- The fifth page (form.html) contains a survey with several questions. After the user of the web application completes it,  I receive the results from it into my survey.db file on my computer. Thanks to this, I can analyze this data and create statistical charts based on it. However, the website user is thanked for completing the survey (thanks.html) and can continue using the website.
- The sixth page (results.html) has graphs showing the results of the surveys. For now, these are false data, but in the future they would be true.

The entire design of the site is saved in the styles.css file. And the culmination of the whole project is adding a purple heart emote as a favicon of the page. (Friends identify me with this emote.)
